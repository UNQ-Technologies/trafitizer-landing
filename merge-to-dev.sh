# Title: Merge Branch into Development
#
# Description: This script merges the current branch into the "development"
#              branch using the GitHub CLI (gh). It excludes specific branches
#              like "development", "production", "testing", and "beta" from
#              being merged. The script creates a pull request and merges it
#              without squashing commits.
